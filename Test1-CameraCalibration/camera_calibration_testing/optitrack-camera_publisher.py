----- OPTITRACKER AND CAMERA PUBLISHER SCRIPT ----- 
This script reads the OptiTracking input and saves to a csv with an allocated 
ID and timestamp, so that it can also be referenced to photos that are taken 
at the same time.
The purpose of this script is to allow for efficient camera calibration 
processes and analysing to be done.
